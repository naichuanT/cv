            transportation is well developed now, it does not mean that the distance between a pair of lovers is close. A long-distance relationship requires more nutrients and effort to keep it.</p>

          <p><h6 class="red">Portfolio Button</h6>This button is too large, and it is easy to cause accidental touch or give people a bad omen in their relationship.</p>

          <p>I boldly used complementary colors in the logo design. Complementary colors are especially pleasing to the eye because different types of photoreceptor cells, which contribute to color vision, perceive different types of light in the color spectrum. But I made adjustments to the tones of these colors, I hope there can be a little more luxury vibe on it.</p>
          <p>In the design of the logo, you can see that it is composed of two circles, these two circles are two bubbles, just like when two people meet, the world of the two people will have many intersections and merge, and the golden line in the outer circle means that the app will help the two people to maintain their own shape while also blending them into each other's world. The gap between the outer circle and the circles is the space the app wants to give the users.</p>
